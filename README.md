# 🌍 EarthCare – Children’s Eco Awareness Application

EarthCare is a playful, interactive eco-education app designed to teach children (ages 6–12) about environmental responsibility through a living Earth simulation, mini-games, and real-world eco-tasks.

This project is built as a clean, demo-ready MVP using dual-mode architecture:
**Kid Mode** for playful interaction  
**Dev Mode** for verification and admin control
